    <h1 class="cover-heading">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>

<h2 class="cover-heading">Who We Are</h2>

Our website address is: https://simplistic.fun

Simplistic Scientists are committed to maintaining strong protections for our customers, products and company. We believe in building and maintaining trust, reducing risk and simply doing what is right.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Learn More</h2>

Simplistic Scientists are committed to protecting your privacy and providing you with a positive experience on our website and through our email marketing campaigns.

This Privacy Statement applies to Simplistic Scientists' website and pages that link to or reference this Privacy Statement and describes how we handle personal information and the choices available to you regarding collection, use, access, and how to update and correct your personal information. Additional information on our personal information practices may be provided in offer descriptions, privacy data sheets, or other notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. 
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">What Personal Data We Collect and Why We Collect It</h2>

"Personal information" is any information that can be used to identify an individual and may include name, address, email address, phone number, login information (account number, password), social media account information, or payment card number.

It may also include device identifiers, data and telemetry (such as IP or MAC address) when such data is linked or tied to a specific person’s device.

If we link other data with your personal information, we will treat that linked data as personal information.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Comments</h2>

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service Privacy Policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
Media
If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Contact forms</h2>

If you fill in a contact form then we will retain the correspondence details in our contact database associated with the provided e-mail address. Please refrain from leaving sensitive personal information. This will be purged after 5 years.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Use of Cookies and Other Web Technologies</h2>

Like many websites and web-based Solutions, Simplistic Scientists use automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to us (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) address, MAC address, clickstream behavior, and telemetry).

These tools help make your visit to our website and Solutions easier, more efficient, and personalized. We also use the information to improve our website and email marketing and provide greater service and value.

We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. You may opt out of this advertising; however, generic, non-personalized ads will continue to be displayed.

For more information, look at our cookies policy or if you would like to opt out of interest-based advertising, please contact greg@simplistic.fun.

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Embedded Content From Other Websites</h2>

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Linked Websites</h2>

We may provide links to other third-party websites and services that are outside our control and not covered by this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy statements posted on the websites you visit.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Analytics</h2>

Analytics will be collected using Google Analytics. Here is the provider’s privacy policy.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Who We Share Your Data With</h2>

We do not share yor data with anyone.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">How Long We Retain Your Data</h2>

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Additional Information</h2>

This site is used for commercial purposes. We do collect e-mail addresses for which you have zero obligation to ever buy anything – you’re welcome to subscribe only to benefit from our valuable free content. You may withdraw this consent at any time by emailing us at support@facetothelight.com. We never sell or distribute your data.
How we protect your data

All staff operating on the data collected by FaceToThe Light.com are extensively trained in data protection policy and law and and they appreciate the need for technical security measures to be put in place to achieve this. All staff are aware of the impact that a regime of up to date implementation of security measures has on preventing vulnerability of data to misuse.
What data breach procedures we have in place

In case of a real or potential data breach the company will deal with it by investigating and mitigating the risk and recurrence of any data breach, if the fault is internal (where subcontractors are implicated they will be contacted and an issue raised with them) and a security incident process will be managed from timely instigation to completion that the Board will monitor and deliver a conclusion to the Director’s satisfaction.
What third parties we receive data from

These are the email marketing platforms you may be subscribed to:

MailerLite

If you make a request to delete your personal data and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements. If you make a request to obtain a copy of or port your personal data, to the extent we have any, we will respond within a reasonable time frame.

We utilize MailerLite for a specific type of correspondence with you; however, you are able to opt-out at the bottom of any and all emails that we send to you. If you’d like us to remove you from every platform at once you can send that request to greg@simplistic.fun with the subject line “Opt Out Of Email Marketing” and we will take care of that request immediately.

To our knowledge all of our data controllers have sent out updates that they are now GDRP compliant. We will continue to monitor and make sure that we only utilize companies who are in compliance with all regulatory requirements.

If our website receives data about users from third parties, including advertisers, this information will be included in the section of our privacy policy dealing with third-party data.
What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data

If our web site provides a service which includes automated decision making – for example, allowing customers to apply for credit, or aggregating their data into an advertising profile – we shall note that this is taking place, and include information about how that information is used, what decisions are made with that aggregated data, and what rights users have over decisions made without human intervention.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="cover-heading">Industry Regulatory Disclosure Requirements</h2>

If we are a member of a regulated industry, or if we are subject to additional privacy laws, we may be required to disclose that information here.
